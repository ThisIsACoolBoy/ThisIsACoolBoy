# About me
Hi! In GitHub I'm named _'ThisIsACoolBoy'_ (might be subject to change accordingly), however I am mostly nicknamed '__doot__' (specifically in Discord) when making things such as package.json(s) or anything that needs me to provide being the author of a project. I am an _early_ inheritor of the area of `programming`, specifically $\textcolor{lime}{\textsf{Node.JS}}$ and $\texolor{blue}{\textsf{Python}}$ .
# Interests
I have a liking of making various personal and private projects, rarely disclosing them to the public, however I like to stay open-source so if I ever do release something I won't hesitate to attempt to make it open-source and customizable. I have an interest in making web-apps, discovering LLMs, looking forward to Artificial Intelligence, and other various topics.
# Personal Goals
A few goals of exploring the programming world include such as
- [ ] Interactive Bots (and Discord ones)
- [x] LLMs
- [ ] Usable Interface
- [x] TensorFlow
- [ ] Customizable AIs
- [ ] GPT models
- [ ] Pretraining
- [x] and Free alternatives for everything
are usually my few goals I want to achieve some time. Most are incomplete but are usually my goals I want to achieve throughout my journey in open-source coding, hopefully making it public eventually.
