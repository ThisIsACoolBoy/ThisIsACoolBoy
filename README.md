# About me
Hi there! My name is `doot`, and I'm a curious new developer. While I go by the nickname "doot" when working on projects like `package.json`, my earliest name was ZKiddyYT in various areas. You might find me changing names from time to time. I'm passionate about the world of programming, with a focus on `Node.JS` and `Python`.

# Interests
I have a deep interest in creating personal and private projects, although I rarely share them with the public. However, I strongly believe in the power of open-source software. If I do release something, I make sure it's open-source and customizable. Some of my interests include developing web applications, exploring Language Models (LLMs), delving into Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, and engaging with various other topics related to technology and software development.

# Personal Goals
Here are a few goals I aspire to achieve in my programming journey:
- [x] Interactive Bots (including Discord bots)
- [x] Language Models (LLMs)
- [ ] User-friendly Interfaces
- [x] TensorFlow
- [ ] Customizable AI solutions
- [ ] GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models
- [ ] Pretraining techniques
- [x] Exploring free alternatives for every aspect of development

While these goals are still in progress, they represent my ambitions as an open-source coder. I hope to make significant contributions and eventually share my projects with the broader community.
